# ImageDiff
A small tool that shows the difference between two images

**Usage:**

Just change the path of the source images: `PATH_IMAGE_A` and `PATH_IMAGE_B`.

As long the input images have the same dimension, the program will output an image containing the areas in wich they differ.

**Example:**

First Image

<img src="image_a.png" alt="Image A" width="160" height="120">

Second Image

<img src="image_b.png" alt="Image A" width="160" height="120">

Result

<img src="output_image.png" alt="Image A" width="160" height="120">
